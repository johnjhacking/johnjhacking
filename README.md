<p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jackson_(hacker)">John Jackson</a>, also known to many as "Mr. Hacking".<br>I am the founder of now defunct hacking group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakura_Samurai_(group)">Sakura Samurai</a>.<br><br>I may not research with a group, however, I'm still continously honing my skills and performing security research. This portfolio will be for organizing all of my work/accomplishments. Keep in mind that I cannot possibly link all of the news articles related to my research, otherwise this portfolio will be too long. In addition, I may link to blog posts from my old website - but my website is outdated and only running for the sake of archive and backlinks; Github will be my primary operating portfolio now.<br><br> I'm also the author of Corporate Cybersecurity: Identifying Risks and The Bug Bounty Program. Click on the image to see my book!<br><br><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Corporate+Cybersecurity:+Identifying+Risks+and+the+Bug+Bounty+Program-p-9781119782520" style="display: block; text-align: left;"><img src="https://media.wiley.com/product_data/coverImage300/2X/11197825/111978252X.jpg" alt="Wikipedia" style="border: none; width: 20%; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: 0;"></a><br><br>My portfolio consists of the following sections:<br> • Certifications: All of the certifications I have achieved, in order of most to least recent.<br> • Created Tools by Popularity: A list of all of the tools I have created that aren't part of guide or a tool specific to a CVE proof of concept.<br>• Guides: Writeups pertaining to education, such as certifications.<br>• My Identified Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVES): My assigned CVE identifiers with a quick summary on each, neatly linked with corresponding writeups or proof of concepts.<br> • Archive: All of the blog posts that I have written, including ones not associated with CVEs.<br><br>
